# Important Info for Contributors

- In the `:common` project, we assume we have access to Fabric and Fabric API, as Quilt (the only other mod loader we currently support) is based upon Fabric.  

In future, the `:common` project will be split out to the mod loader projects for classes that require Fabric/Quilt Loader.  
This will take place after Luminance gets NeoForge support, as I want to have our own Tick() and Resource Pack loader by then.
